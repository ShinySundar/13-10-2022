			<p>The rifle itself has no moral stature, since it has no will of its own. Naturally, it may be used by evil men for evil purposes, but there are more good men than evil, and while the latter cannot be persuaded to the path of righteousness by propaganda, they can certainly be corrected by good men with rifles.</p>
			<h3>When I look at a person, I see a person - not a rank, not a class, not a title</h3>
			<h2>Seeing the glass as half empty is more positive than seeing it as half full. Through such a lens the only choice is to pour more. That is righteous pessimism.</h2>
			<pre>For the believer, humility is honesty about one's greatest flaws to a degree in which he is fearless about truly appearing less righteous than another</pre>
